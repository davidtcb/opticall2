# Setup a notification node

These are useful steps for if you want to run a specific computer to run the notification server to signal using colours. If you have some old kit lying around with very low spec then this could be a useful use for it. We did it with some old think clients from Dell where we installed Debian and given they are really low power are a nice solution to run a headless node with the notification service.


## Setup your linux based environment

> This can be done with Mac and Windows but given our low specc'd computers and only needing a terminal we chose to go with Debian

Our install was a minimal install due to the low hardware specifications. This means we needed to add missing applications and services.
